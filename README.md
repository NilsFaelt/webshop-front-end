# Fullstack Project - Front-end Development Showcase

This project showcases my skills as a front-end developer, where I have taken on multiple roles, including front-end development, backend development, design, and authentication implementation. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in various technologies and libraries.

## Technologies Used

- **Typescript:** I have utilized TypeScript to add static typing and enhance the development experience.
- **Next.js:** The project is built using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and efficient client-side navigation.
- **Styled Components:** I have used Styled Components to create and manage the styling of the components in a modular and reusable way.
- **Klarna:** Integration with Klarna has been implemented to enable seamless payment processing and enhance the user experience.
- **Stripe:** Stripe is used for secure payment handling and processing.
- **Contentful (CMS):** Contentful is integrated as a headless CMS to easily manage and update content for the application.
- **Nest (Node Backend):** I have developed the backend using Nest, a powerful Node.js framework that facilitates the creation of scalable and maintainable server-side logic.
- **MongoDB:** MongoDB is utilized as the database to store and manage application data.
- **Prisma:** Prisma is used as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the database and handle data modeling and querying.
- **Redux:** Redux is employed as a state management library to efficiently manage the application's global state.
- **Tanstack:** Tanstack is used for authentication implementation, where I have developed the authentication flow from scratch.

## Scalability and Component Independence

I have designed the project with scalability in mind, ensuring that each component is independent and has minimal dependencies on other components. This approach enhances code maintainability, reusability, and flexibility. The project is structured to maximize modularity and ease of development.
